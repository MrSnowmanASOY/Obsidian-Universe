Material type:
	Crystal

Material description:
	A material extremely resistant to changing temperatures. 
	Once this material gains or loses temperature it is hard to reverse the change without a large amount of energy.
	Due to this special characteristic, Black Hymthon is very useful when it comes to extreme cooling and heating, allowing it to stay the same temperature for long periods of time while only needing to be heated or cooled occasionally.
